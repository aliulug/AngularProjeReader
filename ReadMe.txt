A tutorial project from CodeCademy.com about creating a reader app with 3 views;
1. a BookShelf to view available books
2. a choosen book's detail page
3. a view for reading book's chapters

Updated version will change the function of "back" button on chapter view from going to book's page to going to previous chapter.
